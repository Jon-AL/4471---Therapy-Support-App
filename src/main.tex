    \section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:problem-definition}
    Therapists and patients encounter many small yet persistent challenges during the therapeutic process concerning the patients' ability to self-manage between sessions.

    While this project`s scope is not large enough to address them all, the following stood out to us:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mood tracking between sessions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Usually, at the start of a session therapists ask for an update about the time since the last session.
            However, self-reporting bias usually means that if the patient is having a bad day or is in a bad mood, their view on the time since the last session is skewed, sometimes heavily.
            Further, memory can be corrupted and events can easily be forgotten.
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item numerical (including descriptions of the numeric values, to increase clarity)
%                \item statistical (based on numerical inputs)
%                \item descriptive (``gloomy``, ``sad``, etc)
%            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Medication management
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inventory (to not run out of important medications, mood stabilizers are a good example in the context of mental health especially)
            \item Persistence (taking medications as required and without missing a day)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Symptoms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Medical (unrelated to the patients diagnosed )
        \end{itemize}
        \item Other self care aspects, such as sleeping, eating, etc.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

    In many ways, the project did not go according to plan.
    We made a number of mistakes, but we believe the biggest was not making the project in Kotlin.
    Making the project in Kotlin would have allowed us to make the app's UI programmatically, which would have been a huge improvement.
    Additionally, this project turned out to be far larger in scope than we anticipated, simply because we were learning as we went.

    In summary, many mistakes were made, but making such mistakes in a project where the intention is learning is exactly the right time to make them - and therefore we believe that those mistakes were (overall, at least) a positive.
