    \section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:problem-definition}
    Therapists and patients encounter many challenges during the therapeutic process.
    There are a number of small yet persistent problems for therapists revolve around their patients' self-management between sessions.
    This software's intention is to help patients in doing so.
    Among the many problems, the following stand out (in the order of important:)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item mood tracking between sessions
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item numerical (including descriptions of the numeric values, to increase clarity)
            \item statistical (based on numerical inputs)
            \item descriptive (``gloomy``, ``sad``, etc)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Medication management
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inventory
            \item Persistence (taking medications as required)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Symptoms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Medical (unrelated to the patients diagnosed )
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}


    \section{Project Objective}\label{sec:project-objective}

    \subsection{General objective guidelines}\label{subsec:general-objective-guidelines}
    Patients should be able to generate a report about their mood and medication for their therapy session in one to three clicks between each therapy session.

    Therapists should be able to see their patient's mood and medication reports in one to two clicks between each therapy session.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Learning the process of project development through application of knowledge acquired during the Computer Science 4471A Course.
        \item The creation of an intuitive and user friendly self-management mobile app (Android and/or i/OS).
    \end{enumerate}


    \section{Stakeholders List}\label{sec:stakeholders-list}
