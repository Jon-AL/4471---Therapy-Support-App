    \section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:problem-definition}
    Therapists and patients encounter many small yet persistent challenges during the therapeutic process concerning the patients' ability to self-manage between sessions.

    While this project`s scope is not large enough to address them all, the following stood out to us:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mood tracking between sessions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Usually, at the start of a session therapists ask for an update about the time since the last session.
            However, self-reporting bias usually means that if the patient is having a bad day or is in a bad mood, their view on the time since the last session is skewed, sometimes heavily.
            Further, memory can be corrupted and events can easily be forgotten.
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item numerical (including descriptions of the numeric values, to increase clarity)
%                \item statistical (based on numerical inputs)
%                \item descriptive (``gloomy``, ``sad``, etc)
%            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Medication management
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inventory (to not run out of important medications, mood stabilizers are a good example in the context of mental health especially)
            \item Persistence (taking medications as required and without missing a day)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Symptoms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Medical (unrelated to the patients diagnosed )
        \end{itemize}
        \item Other self care aspects, such as sleeping, eating, etc.
    \end{itemize}

    Unfortunately, writing the code in Java meant that our chosen architecture (Model-View-ViewModel) was not feasible, resulting in needing to change the System Architecture to Model View Controller very late in development.

    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

    Our project, in many ways, did not go according to plan.
    We made a number of mistakes, but we believe the biggest was not making the project in Kotlin.
